One time period
a2. Create 'lapse.csv' (a list of all records, with lapsed policies marked) - Done
a3. Use 'lapse.csv' to create 'rate.csv' which contain lapse rates - Done
a4. Use 'rate.csv' to create a AI model of the lapse rates 'lapse.tf'. Present graphically- Done
a5. Use 'lapse.tf' (lapse model) to project 'lapse.csv' (which contains all policies) - Done

Two time periods - Data (using a3 and a4 from single time period - no need to redo these two)
b1. Create 'data_s.csv' (data at the start) and 'data_e.csv' (data at the end - without lapses) - Done
b2. Create 'lapse.csv' (a list of all records, with lapsed policies marked) - Done
a3. Use 'lapse.csv' to create 'rate.csv' which contain lapse rates - Done
a4. Use 'rate.csv' to create an AI model of the lapse rates 'lapse.tf'. Present graphically- Done
b5. Create a lapse table 'lapse_table.csv' so that the AI doesn't need to run every time period
b6. Use 'lapse_table' (lapse table) to project (which contains all policies) - Done
b7. Run the same policy at the start and end, and compare - Done

To Do:
1. Finish analysis of change
 - Make a merged table with all start data, all end data, NPV0 and NPV1 - Done
 - Add extra column to categorise change (lapse, continuing) - Done [This is not an analysis of change vs expected, just what has changed]
 - Add up those columns - Done
2. Add new business
 - Add to data_e - Done
 - Add to category - Done
 - Check lapse investigation still work - Done
3. Add prod_code
 - Add to 'data_s.csv' and 'data_e.csv'
 - Use it to lookup "fee.csv"
4. Make a table of the change in value
 - End = Start + NB - Lapses +/- changes to existing
5. Set up GUI
6. Make generic / Remove hard-coded variables
 - specify a range of files to create lapse rates
 - specify a list of variables to be carried throughout the analysis




Projection model
Use 'data_s.csv' and 'data_e.csv' to calc the value at the start and end of the period, and decompose the change
 - Add analysis of change to model
 - Decompose change in value based on inflows, outflows and investment return
 - Allow for multiple policies
 - Show change in value by segment


Projection Model
 - Base model - Done
 - Add fees - Done
 - Add expenses - Done
 - Add value - Done
 - Multiple policies - Done
 - Add age - Done
 - Connect to data file - Done
 - Present the model (de-compose value by age, adviser) - Done
 - Create permanent model - Done
 - Access permanent model - Done
 - Use lapse rates from the AI model - Done
