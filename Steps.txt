Steps
1. Create the underlying lapse model - Done
2. Create a set of data based on this model - Done
3. Determine lapse rates based on that data - Done
4. Create a AI model of the lapse rates - Done
5. Present lapse rates graphically

Projection Model
6. Base model - Done
7. Add fees
8. Add expenses
9. Add value
10. Present the model (de-compose value by age, adviser)
11. Use lapse rates from the AI model

Two time periods - Data
12. Start with two months of data and create lapse table based on differencing (add identifier to data)
13. Add more parameters to the data (gender, FUM, duration)

Two time periods - Projection model
14. Add analysis of change to model
15. Decompose change in value based on inflows, outflows and investment return
16. Show change in value by segment
